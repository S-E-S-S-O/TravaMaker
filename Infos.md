# **__TRAVA MAKER__**

We are proud to introduce you **Trava Maker**

**Version**: 1.0 **CURRENTLY IN WORKING**

**Who made it?** 
It was made by **LeonDev**, **Lojacops** and **Takaso**.

**What's the story behind this?**
 Simple, LeonDev and Lojacops were talking about the making of a new library, so Lojacops wanted to joke about a
person that said "`Takaso skids travas`" saying ironically to make a library that creates travas, this is the start of this new library. 

**What are **`Travas`**?**
Travas are a large amount of emojis/text that are usually used to crash your WhatsApp, Discord and other apps. This library is perfect for making them. The travas will get logged in a txt file.
