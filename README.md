# travamaker
A python library to make travas...

Version: 1.0 **CURRENTLY IN WORKING**

Authors: Leondev, Lojacops, Takaso.

Story: _so, yes, that's a few cringe huh?_ No.

A great man (and great skid and lamer) named "Mozzie" said "Takaso is a trava skidder"

Lojacops discussed with leondev about projects to be done, I said to make a lib to do trava, also to humiliate mozzie.
